<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">I'm so happy about this new Radiohead video that has just come out:<br/><a href="http://code.google.com/creative/radiohead/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/creative/radiohe<wbr></wbr>ad/</a><br/><br/>Here are some of the things I like about it:<br/><br/>1) It uses two different types of 3D scanning equipment.<br/><br/>2) They've made no attempt to render the points realistically, they just leave them as pixels.<br/><br/>3) They deliberately degrade the quality of the 3d scans, to get more arty looking data.<br/><br/>4) It looks really rubbish at the end. Like a student project or something. Bless them.<br/><br/>5) The main web page is at <a href="http://code.google.com" rel="nofollow">code.google.com</a>, Google's sourceforge-like place for hosting open source projects. This is just too geeky for words. <br/><br/>6) We went to visit <a href="http://www.geometricinformatics.com/" rel="nofollow">Geometric Informatics</a> last year, on my first and only business trip since joining <a href="http://www.eurocom.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Eurocom</a>. One thing you can see in the video is that the scanner can't capture more than a few seconds of face data because it fills up the hard-drive.<br/><br/>The making-of video is much more interesting than the final video. They obviously had a lot of fun making it which is the important thing.<br/><br/><b>... later ...</b><br/><br/>7) They have given away all the 3D data used to make this video. Here's a frame rendered with greyscale spheres:<br/><br/><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/tim.hutton/SHybqsutN9I/AAAAAAAABhY/47rEyUBzxvg/s800/thom_yorke_4d.jpg"/></div>
