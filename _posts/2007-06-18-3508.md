<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext"><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=40406" rel="nofollow">The Inquirer</a> has a photo of the Turing statue to be unveiled tomorrow at <a href="http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk" rel="nofollow">Bletchley Park</a>. It's made from thousands of pieces of slate, and is rather beautiful:<br/><br/><img src="http://www.theinquirer.net/images/articles/%20Turing%20statue%20head.JPG"/><br/><br/>The article links to a politely irate <a href="http://uk.gay.com/article/news/uk/5625" rel="nofollow">email exchange</a> between Bletchley and Gay.com, who think that Turing's gayness should be more prominent.<br/><br/>If you have any interest in computers at all, you really must make time in your life to visit Bletchley Park to see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer" rel="nofollow">Colossus</a> rebuild and all the run-down sheds where the war was won.</div>
