This is [a great recipe for ciabatta](http://www.notyourmotherscookbook.com/the-baker-bread-machine-ciabatta-bread/).
It is very easy, if you have a bread machine.

Below I've converted to grams, and simplified a little. Mostly this is for my own reference, but let me know if you use it!

Here is a picture some bread I made with it:

Make the starter, using your bread machine's dough setting:
* 118g water
* 192g bread flour
* 0.5 teaspoon of bread machine yeast

Leave it in the bread machine for 9 to 12 hours after mixing.

Then add the other ingredients:
* 207g warm water
* 2 tablespoons milk
* 2 teaspoons olive oil
* 1.5 teaspoons of bread machine yeast
* 254g bread flour
* 1.5 teaspoons of salt

Again use the dough setting on the bread machine. When it is done, put it in the fridge for 6 to 12 hours.

To bake, spread some flour on a baking tray. I use a teflon baking sheet, which stops it getting stuck. Then pour the dough on top.
(It's so sloppy, this is all you can do!)

Leave to rise for two hours, then bake at 220 degrees C for 20 to 25 minutes.
