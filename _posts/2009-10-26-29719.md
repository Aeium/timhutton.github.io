title: put a blanket over your head
---

<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">If you're two years old, and even if you're not, possibly the most fun you can have is to put a blanket over your head. Especially if someone's under there with you, you can tickle them unexpectedly, or just look at each other and laugh in the strange pink and orange light. You can pretend to hide from everyone else in the room, and giggle as they pretend to look for you and pretend not to hear you giggling.<br/><br/>I don't have any photos but now in my head is a group of neurons forever dedicated to keeping alive the memory of sitting on the floor on Saturday with Turtle and Monkey, all of us hiding under a blanket, while <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAI2doCUbNc" rel="nofollow">Divenire</a> played in the background.
