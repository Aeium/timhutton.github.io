<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">This appeared in the small ads section of our local paper:<br/><br/><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tim.hutton/Storage/photo#5178427906971044914" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/tim.hutton/R914vrH6jDI/AAAAAAAABE8/V0ppgadvrH4/s400/eps_not_found.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>EPS is an image format, so this error message means that they've lost the advert file but haven't noticed. It's only a matter of time before someone has "404: page not found" carved on their gravestone.</div>
