title: my grandpa's fork
---

<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">When we started gardening a few years ago, my parents gave me the garden fork that had been my grandpa's. A lovely old wooden thing, quite delicate.<br/><br/>So delicate in fact, that after using it a lot I managed to break it. For a while it sat in a broken state with the other tools, looking sad. And I was sad too. But then recently Turtle was given an old trike, one that had been well-loved and was missing its handle - and so now the old fork handle lives on! You can see it here behind Turtle:<br/><br/><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/r4myHioagm0IuUK57R8eiw?feat=embedwebsite" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/Sm364QJtc4I/AAAAAAAACt8/7aoso4WGHhc/s400/PICT0033.JPG"/></a><blockquote><i>(she doesn't look impressed with Microserfs)</i><blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></div>
