Interestingly, the age of the universe is 13.75 billion years, so collectively the people living on Earth right now have lived more than 16 times the age of the universe.<br/><br/><font size="-3"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jadis1958/4229368046/" rel="nofollow">Image source</a></font></div><p><hr></p><p>This post was <a href="http://ferkeltongs.livejournal.com/32660.html">originally on LiveJournal</a>.</p>
