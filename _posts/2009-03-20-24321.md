<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">So we managed to leave the car with just the marmot. A few steps later though she asked for turtle, so we had to go back for it. She can't be fooled so easily.<br/><br/>Off we go again but then she remembers her dog, so I give her her dog and her lion and of course I have to carry them for her because four animals is really too many for anyone to carry.<br/><br/>She couldn't have been happier going into nursery. She walked over to the sand table where the other toddlers were playing and by the time she got there the marmot and turtle were on the floor behind her, forgotten.<br/><br/><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/XmaJtiym81IIu8FTd4xvCQ?feat=embedwebsite" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/SRCwYD7lh8I/AAAAAAAABrk/yhODEkyuJnM/s288/PICT0025.JPG"/></a><br/><br/>(Our own baby Turtle likes to take her toy animals to work with her.)</div><p><hr></p><p>This post was <a href="http://ferkeltongs.livejournal.com/24321.html">originally on LiveJournal</a>.</p>
