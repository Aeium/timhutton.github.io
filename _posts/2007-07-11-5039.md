<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">On my way home from work last night, I saw a man pushing a buggy along. He looked towards a pair of magpies on the grass, and saluted them. It's supposed to be a secret, you fool! If the world finds out about our magpie overlords the pigeons will get angry and will lay waste across Britain.<br/><br/>In other news, a song came on the radio called "Selfish Jean", which the internet now tells me might have been by Travis, which at least explains the geeky reference. And didn't U2 have a recent song called "Origin of the Species"? Next week I'm anticipating Lily Allen's catchy new song "A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid".</div>
