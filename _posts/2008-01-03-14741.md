<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext"><a href="http://arts.independent.co.uk/music/features/article3303572.ece" rel="nofollow">link</a><br/><br/><b>Q:</b> What ambition drives a highly successful band like Radiohead, that's existed for 16 years, to work?<br/><br/><b>Yorke:</b> In previous years, there were times when we didn't know the answer to that question. We started families, brought up our children and everybody was just living their own lives. But then one day it just got us again. You're stuck in traffic on a Friday, the kids are wailing in the back, the supermarket shopping is boiling in the boot, it's summer, the weekend of the Glastonbury Festival. A radio station airs a listeners' poll, asking which band the people associate with their best Glastonbury memories, and 76 per cent are voting for Radiohead. Suddenly things shoot through your mind: what am I doing here? Wouldn't I prefer to be on stage there? Even my family would be happier if I didn't hang out at home, all grumpy, any more. Yes, that's how it was.<br/><br/><img src="http://www.independent.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00262/yorke380_262130b.jpg"/></div><p><hr></p><p>This post was <a href="http://ferkeltongs.livejournal.com/14741.html">originally on LiveJournal</a>.</p>
