<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">Yesterday I went to the doctor about a red itchy patch that has appeared on my jawline. He informed me that I had impetigo, and wrote me a prescription.<br/><br/>I should have been asking how serious it was, and whether I would die, and whether it was contagious but all I could think was: I've got a disease with a <i>proper</i> Victorian-sounding name, woo-hoo!<br/><br/><font size="-2">(It's not at all serious, don't worry. Google for it if you really must.)</font></div>
