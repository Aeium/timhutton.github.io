title: insurance upsell
---

<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">Just booked something online, got a confirmation email. In the top-right corner was a link just saying "<b>insurance upsell</b>". I had to go and look up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up-selling" rel="nofollow">what it meant</a>.<br/><br/>Now of course we're used to having to decline multiple unnecessary add-ons like "extended warranty" and "cancellation insurance" but they don't normally come across quite so bluntly. I suspect there was some formatting in the email that got lost along the way, exposing their marketing speak. It felt like when a web page script goes wrong and exposes the code instead of the content.</div>
