title: doodles and coral reefs
---

<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">I was doodling idly on some paper the other day, and things got a bit out of hand because trying to understand what was happening led me into the world of "Schläfli symbols" and hyperbolic geometry, and finally into crochet, coral reefs and curly kale. <br/><br/>Here are the instructions for this particular type of doodle:<br/><br/><table border="1" cellpadding="10"><tr><td><br/>1. Draw an n-sided figure.<br/>2. From each corner, extend out more lines until there are p in total coming from that corner.<br/>3. Fill in the gaps between the lines with more n-sided polygons.<br/>4. Repeat from step 2.<br/><br/></td></tr></table><br/><br/>Step 1. Let's choose n=5, the pentagon:<br/><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/SoQ5Zcy_jPI/AAAAAAAACwc/zYvxT7BQppc/s800/5-3_1.png"/><br/>Step 2. Let's choose p=3, so we just need to draw one extra line on each corner:<br/><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/SoQ5ZaRubRI/AAAAAAAACvU/vJJkeUQiNc0/s800/5-3_2.png"/><br/>Step 3. We fill in the gaps with more pentagons:<br/><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/SoQ5usxFWRI/AAAAAAAACvY/i-q8MQdqucE/s800/5-3_3.png"/><br/>Step 2 again: We add five more lines on the outside where needed:<br/><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/SoQ5u5Tr2jI/AAAAAAAACvc/oVYkv3z69nc/s800/5-3_4.png"/><br/>Step 3 again: We add more pentagons in the gaps. They're a bit stretched but that's ok.<br/><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/SoQ5u2_qPkI/AAAAAAAACvg/8pcAoKC0k1c/s800/5-3_5.png"/><br/>Step 2 again: Oh wait, there are already 3 lines coming from each corner. We can't go any further. The doodling algorithm has come to a stop.<br/><br/>Hmmm... well it's kind of pretty but so what?<br/><br/>Let's do another one, with n=6 (hexagons). Step 1:<br/><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/SoQ5u1kxZCI/AAAAAAAACvk/O1WjOoCoB20/s800/6-3_1.png"/><br/>Step 2: extend one more line from each corner:<br/><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/SoQ5u8TbIzI/AAAAAAAACvo/haMa6-qwWQ0/s800/6-3_2.png"/><br/>Step 3: join the lines up with more hexagons:<br/><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/SoQ52Qd6rFI/AAAAAAAACvs/WkS7DCWXMm0/s800/6-3_3.png"/><br/>Step 2 again: more lines:<br/><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/SoQ52cIA46I/AAAAAAAACvw/aUDvAT48KCQ/s800/6-3_4.png"/><br/>Step 3 again: more hexagons:<br/><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/SoQ52SITwUI/AAAAAAAACv0/COJzXXyTJWc/s800/6-3_5.png"/><br/><br/>We're drawing a honeycomb, and can continue this for as long as we want - unlike the pentagon case this one goes on forever without ever coming to a stop.<br/><br/>Let's try one more, with n=7 (heptagons). Step 1:<br/><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/SoQ52eUe9NI/AAAAAAAACv4/WqoiJun8NfU/s800/7-3_1.png"/><br/>Step 2: extend a line from each corner:<br/><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/SoQ52qKisMI/AAAAAAAACv8/amMSEXGBSq0/s800/7-3_2.png"/><br/>Step 3: join the lines up with heptagons:<br/><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/SoQ569MN_SI/AAAAAAAACwA/Hxg_hBPZllk/s800/7-3_3.png"/><br/>Step 2 again: extend a line from each corner that needs one:<br/><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/SoQ568m_rFI/AAAAAAAACwI/PLznjGmAjI0/s800/7-3_4.png"/><br/>Step 3 again: fill in the gaps with heptagons. <br/><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/SoQ5651tPMI/AAAAAAAACwE/OQOMvQUfXz4/s800/7-3_5.png"/><br/>Wow that's a lot of heptagons already. Let's stop there.<br/><br/>With n=7 and greater it quickly gets hard to draw because there are too many polygons around the outside. It's not like the n=6 case where the tiling was nice and regular. You can draw the n=7 case on a piece of paper but only by making the outer polygons get smaller and smaller, or more and more stretched. Wikipedia has a page with the same drawing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order-3_heptagonal_tiling" rel="nofollow">here</a> and tells us that the method of making the polygons get smaller and smaller is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model" rel="nofollow">Poincaré disk model</a> for rendering <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry" rel="nofollow">hyperbolic geometry</a>. It also tells us that this tiling is given the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol" rel="nofollow">Schläfli symbol</a> {7,3} because n=7 and p=3.<br/><br/>Let's try one last one, with n=4 (still with p=3 lines from each corner). Step 1:<br/><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/SoQ5ZMx0psI/AAAAAAAACvE/HAaMaOiSKDw/s800/4-3_1.png"/><br/>Step 2: extend lines from each corner:<br/><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/SoQ5ZDLT4WI/AAAAAAAACvI/VkQ9nIPRkZc/s800/4-3_2.png"/><br/>Step 3: join up the lines with squares (well, squashed squares):<br/><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/SoQ5ZYFy2HI/AAAAAAAACvM/CKQsYvsw-9I/s800/4-3_3.png"/><br/>Step 2 again: nothing to do, every corner already has 3 lines coming out.<br/><br/>There's something familiar about this image - it looks like a cube. And now when you think about it the finished n=5 image at the top looks like a flattened <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Dodecahedron.html" rel="nofollow">dodecahedron</a>. Those two doodles ended up by closing in on themselves (much like the way <a href="http://ferkeltongs.livejournal.com/23919.html" rel="nofollow">clathrin</a> does when it assembles itself). But for n=6 you get a flat plane, while the n=7 graph gets all jammed up at the edges. There's something very odd going on.<br/><br/>Let's make a table of what happens for different values of n and p:<br/><br/><table border="1" cellpadding="2">
<tr><th rowspan="2">p (number of lines coming from each point)</th><th colspan="5">n (number of sides on each polygon)</th></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td bgcolor="#ffffcc"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron" rel="nofollow">tetrahedron</a></td><td bgcolor="#ffffcc"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube" rel="nofollow">cube</a></td><td bgcolor="#ffffcc"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedron" rel="nofollow">dodecahedron</a></td><td bgcolor="#ccffcc"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_tiling" rel="nofollow">plane</a></td><td><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order-3_heptagonal_tiling" rel="nofollow">hyperbolic</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td bgcolor="#ffffcc"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron" rel="nofollow">octohedron</a></td><td bgcolor="#ccffcc"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_tiling" rel="nofollow">plane</a></td><td><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order-4_pentagonal_tiling" rel="nofollow">hyperbolic</a></td><td>hyperbolic</td><td>hyperbolic</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td bgcolor="#ffffcc"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedron" rel="nofollow">icosahedron</a></td><td><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order-5_square_tiling" rel="nofollow">hyperbolic</a></td><td>hyperbolic</td><td>hyperbolic</td><td>hyperbolic</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td bgcolor="#ccffcc"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_tiling" rel="nofollow">plane</a></td><td>hyperbolic</td><td>hyperbolic</td><td>hyperbolic</td><td>hyperbolic</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order-7_triangular_tiling" rel="nofollow">hyperbolic</a></td><td>hyperbolic</td><td>hyperbolic</td><td>hyperbolic</td><td>hyperbolic</td></tr>
</table><br/><br/>All five <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid" rel="nofollow">platonic solids</a> appear in this table like magic. All three <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_by_regular_polygons" rel="nofollow">regular tilings</a> of the plane appear too. The rest of the table is all hyperbolic.<br/><br/>(This table isn't my discovery, by the way, it's just the table of Schläfli symbols for regular polygons. But I've never seen it written out in full like this.)<br/><br/>(There's also an interesting symmetry in the table above. Take any two entries that are positioned symmetrically across the diagonal, like {5,3} and {3,5}, the dodecahedron and icosahedron. These shapes/tilings are <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DualTessellation.html" rel="nofollow">duals</a> of each other. Entries along the diagonal are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_polyhedron#Self-dual_polyhedra" rel="nofollow">self-dual</a>.)<br/><br/>So what is this hyperbolic geometry? It's actually more familiar than you might think. Lettuce is a good example:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trinity/43900/" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/1/43900_487870e2ff_m.jpg"/> (source)</a> <br/><br/>You can take any part of a lettuce leaf and flatten it down, but you can't flatten the whole thing without folding or tearing it. Curly kale is more extreme:<br/><br/><a href="http://cleanerplateclub.wordpress.com/2009/04/15/kale-crochet-and-the-hyperbolic-coral-reef-project/" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://cleanerplateclub.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/kale-leaf.jpg?w=320&amp;h=240"/> (source)</a><br/><br/>It gets more and more frilled as you move away from the stalk, just like our heptagons got more and more jammed in. It's closely related to the fractal branching of trees, except that the branches stay joined together by flaps of skin. The veins on a lettuce leaf show this very clearly.<br/><br/>You can make your own hyperbolic geometry by cutting out lots of heptagons from paper and sellotaping them together. The resulting sheet will leap off the table into a frilled form exactly like lettuce.
