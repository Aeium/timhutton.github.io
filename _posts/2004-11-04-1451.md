<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">I had my first email from Peru today (country code .pe). It triggered all sorts of thoughts about whether the internet was at all accessible to the poor of the world, and if it were, what effect that would have on world government - because they could potentially join a global democracy and circumvent local democracy - a la Monbiot's latest book. But then I told myself not to be so silly. But still I see llamas and rocky landscapes in my head.<br/><br/>In other news, my snot smells funny - what does that mean? (I do have a cold, but I don't recall it ever causing odourous mucous before)<br/><br/>(rick has now had soup for three meals in a row. seriously - his stomach will rebel when he tries to take in solids)</div>
