title: new emoticon!
---

<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">This is hot news. I know you'll be as excited as I am.<br/><br/>Many a time you've wanted to express cheery approval using a compact symbol but had no way of doing so. <br/><br/>Now, thanks to tireless research, scientists* have discovered a new emoticon that fits the bill.<br/><br/>Here it is:<br/><br/>(are you ready?)<br/><br/>-m <br/><br/>(thumbs up)<br/><br/><br/>I know. I know. You're as astonished as I am. How can something so useful and simple have been neglected until now? Surely this emoticon already exists? Well, find a previous example and prove me wrong. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><br/><br/>"nexttoyou" (on <a href="http://www.funkysnooker.com" rel="nofollow">funkysnooker</a>) was the first person to write this emoticon, albeit unintentionally. The resemblance to a thumbs up was noticed, and a new emoticon was born.</div>
