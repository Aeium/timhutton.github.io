title: Cryptonomicon and the Baroque Cycle
---

<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">Just finished reading the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baroque_Cycle" rel="nofollow">Baroque Cycle</a>, Neal Stephenson's wonderful romp through the 18th century. The three books are a prequel to the equally awesome <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptonomicon" rel="nofollow">Cryptonomicon</a> which is set in more recent times. Here are all four books stacked on my bookshelf:<br/><br/><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/duJxNp0xNqebXF36Ib2-Rg?feat=embedwebsite" rel="nofollow"><img height="397" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/TcmjpmmDv-I/AAAAAAAAEIE/X1rSg6Fgoro/s400/baroque_cycle.jpg" width="400"/></a><br/><br/>Reading it on holiday:<br/><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/oNGtOkJsNh1zpLwZ0CIWbw?feat=embedwebsite" rel="nofollow"><img height="108" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4RxpjF-2p1E/TgJ7wq0gtXI/AAAAAAAAEYw/rTGk0DJJ_Sw/s144/IMG_1785.JPG" width="144"/></a> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/at_QLrBCtlAEL9evp6frWQ?feat=embedwebsite" rel="nofollow"><img height="108" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0NGSQwrtAjw/TgJ74j8dIiI/AAAAAAAAEY8/NtVk6-ndnac/s144/IMG_1787.JPG" width="144"/></a> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/h-buwrYY5co6n1RsMWp9Ng?feat=embedwebsite" rel="nofollow"><img height="108" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-wu9yH_b3BOU/TgJ8ASv4LUI/AAAAAAAAEZE/Eh1Yv9k-k94/s144/IMG_1791.JPG" width="144"/></a><br/><br/>If you've read any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Harris_(novelist)" rel="nofollow">Robert Harris</a> and enjoyed his alternative history novels like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatherland_(novel)" rel="nofollow">Fatherland</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archangel_%28Robert_Harris_novel%29" rel="nofollow">Archangel</a> then these books might appeal. The sheer amount of scholarship that's gone into them is mind boggling, and matched only by the sheer amount of fun that the characters get up to.<br/><br/><font size="-4">* That picture seems to have included many of my favourite books in the background - except <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Need_to_Talk_About_Kevin" rel="nofollow">We need to talk about Kevin</a> - I don't remember reading that yet.</font></div><p><hr></p><p>This post was <a href="http://ferkeltongs.livejournal.com/33733.html">originally on LiveJournal</a>.</p>
