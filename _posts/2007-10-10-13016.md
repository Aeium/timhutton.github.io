<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">The new Radiohead album is sounding nice. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.inrainbows.com" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/tim.hutton/Rwz_DF7V5eI/AAAAAAAAAqc/UcYqBaVt_eo/s288/in_rainbows.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>It's interesting that they're getting a lot of positive press for their 'name your own price' downloading scheme. People like the idea that 'all the money goes to the band' instead of some vampirical mafiaa. <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/observermusic/2007/10/rainbow_warriors.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><br/><br/>But this is sadly untrue; the final download screen says 'This music is published by Warner Chappell Music Publishing'. Which is a subsidiary of Warner Music: <a href="http://www.warnerchappell.com/wcm_2/home2.jsp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> - and they even link to the album from the Warner site. So, the music company is clearly getting their usual cut, and all the press hype is classic viral. Oh well.</div>
