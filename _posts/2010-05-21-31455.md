title: A Slanted Hexagon
---

<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">We've known for a while that the easiest way to simulate hexagonal cellular automata on a square grid is to use a slanted neighborhood:<br/><br/><table><tr><td><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Is7-NBphpIq1ycrWg6dglw?feat=embedwebsite" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/TBJniHbr1sI/AAAAAAAADh8/5Q5rL1ICF9o/s800/square_grid_colored.png"/></a></td><td>corresponds to</td><td><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FZpSaYEtxSmmnyEs6XFcVw?feat=embedwebsite" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/TBJnL3tJpkI/AAAAAAAADhY/mAd4NTdq_Hc/s800/hex_grid_colored.png"/></a></td></tr></table><br/><br/>(I don't know who first thought of this, by the way. There's a reference to it from <a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lifeline_Volume_2" rel="nofollow">June 1971</a>, for example.)<br/><br/>It works because the hexagonal tiling can be lined up with a (slanted) square tiling, like this:<br/><br/><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ayLQXv4ASc06yUPn9wAMtQ?feat=embedwebsite" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/TBJnbCZtM6I/AAAAAAAADhc/xWkEZT_kE74/s144/hex_grid_overlaid.png"/></a><br/><br/>Using this slanted neighborhood in <a href="http://golly.sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow">Golly</a> we can run interesting CA, like <a href="http://www.frank-buss.de/automaton/hexautomaton.html" rel="nofollow">Frank Buss' HexLife</a>:<br/><br/><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/56QkFpm9pjskC-mQ27z8OQ?feat=embedwebsite" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/TBJnhk0aqmI/AAAAAAAADh0/lnFo8frxch0/s144/hexBuss_squares.png"/></a><br/><br/>The problem is that it's supposed to look more like this:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.frank-buss.de/automaton/emitter.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/TBJqk0rWfjI/AAAAAAAADi0/F6uu7fIC8ag/s144/emitter.gif"/></a><br/><br/>It needs hexagons to show the connections between the cells properly.<br/><br/>For the moment we're not about to start changing Golly to render this properly. We may do in the future. For now we have a Plan B, which is to use icons to show the hexagons instead. The problem is: what should the icons look like? <br/><br/>After playing with a few candidates and not getting very far I sat down and thought about it and came up with an answer that seems right and is quite satisfying. Here's my reasoning:<br/><br/>Here's the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_uniform_tilings" rel="nofollow">dual</a> of the square tiling in the earlier image, showing how our hexagon icons should lie on top of our squares:<br/><br/><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/PMw3lJq068I234drDwN3Mw?feat=embedwebsite" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/TBJnbQGVhpI/AAAAAAAADho/gc24_FrWBJE/s144/hex_grid_overlaid_dual.png"/></a><br/><br/>The problem now is that the hexagons lie partly outside each square, and we can't draw those bits because we don't know what colour those cells should be. A nice solution is to <i>inset</i> the hexagon just enough that it fits in the square:<br/><br/><table><tr><td><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/sA-uNDuEaQf_-9i3xtSwXA?feat=embedwebsite" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/TBJnbZrf3QI/AAAAAAAADhk/NoqBuFSwBEc/s800/hex_grid_overlaid_dua_trimmedl.png"/></a></td><td>becomes</td><td><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/SnoTq7XJOOpdbnul1qIIIQ?feat=embedwebsite" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/TBJnbKaIOSI/AAAAAAAADhg/4vggwY_c3Sk/s800/hex_grid_overlaid_dua_trimmed_inset.png"/></a></td></tr></table><br/><br/>Now imagine <i>un-slanting</i> the blue square, taking the red hexagon with it. This gives us the shape we're looking for:<br/><br/><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/9s2I9OZ6U5kI39PG5dfhXA?feat=embedwebsite" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/TBJniDWkXFI/AAAAAAAADiA/vA-aoJAJvhg/s800/square_grid_inset_hex.png"/></a><br/><br/>With a little thought you can work out that the coordinates of the corners are all multiples of 0.25. Clockwise from top: (0.25,0) (0.75,0.25) (1,0.75) (0.75,1) (0.25,0.75) (0,0.25)<br/><br/>Now we can fill in the slanted hexagon with whatever colour we want and we're good to go. Here's an animation of Frank Buss' CA in action. A spinning emitter sends out gliders in all six directions. <br/><br/><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FL557vjlFf6o2gEJ97Tx_w?feat=embedwebsite" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/TBJnbcpgMjI/AAAAAAAADhs/PJWquy_k5JE/s800/HexBuss_anim2.gif"/></a><br/><br/>And here's a simple snowflake CA:<br/><br/><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/0s0lBYUyhtlg_d4GaxjShQ?feat=embedwebsite" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/TBJnh7QgUyI/AAAAAAAADh4/OMelhlWracE/s800/snowflake_anim.gif"/></a><br/><br/>It looks pretty good, apart from the slanting of course. The gaps between the hexagons are just about acceptable. Let me know if you can think of a better way of doing it.<br/><br/>I won't even show you my earlier efforts which I'm just embarrassed about now. This solution is so obviously right I should have thought of it earlier.<br/><br/>Support for hexagonal neighborhoods will be arriving in Golly 2.2, hopefully within a couple of months. Until then you can always build <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/golly/develop" rel="nofollow">the latest source</a> yourself.<br/><br/>The only downside of these new icons is that it takes the pressure off Golly ever needing to render hexagonal grids properly...<br/><br/><font size="-2"><b>Edited:</b> to match earlier conventions we've chosen the other slanting direction, so I've changed the images to match.</font></div>
