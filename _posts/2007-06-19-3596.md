title: Refilling your entropy pool
---

<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">Did you know, Linux has an '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random" rel="nofollow">entropy pool</a>' that collects randomness from its environment, in order to be able to give you good random numbers when you need them.<br/><br/>It collects things like the timings between key presses, and the retrieval time of internet access, as the lower-order bits of these (eg. the hundredths of a second) are likely to be randomly distributed. <br/><br/>It can even <i>run out of randomness</i>, and revert to a more predictable state, giving you only pseudo-random numbers generated by algorithm.<br/><br/>I only tell you this because when I first read about this entropy pool it struck me that humans are much the same. If you've been isolated for a long time, without having to deal with random strangeness  and nonsense, then you start to feel a bit predictable. It's depressing to be able to tell what you're going to do at any given moment, far more exciting to constantly surprise yourself with your quick-thinking quirkiness when you have a healthy entropy pool to draw on.<br/><br/>Get out there and soak up some randomness!</div><p><hr></p><p>This post was <a href="http://ferkeltongs.livejournal.com/3596.html">originally on LiveJournal</a>.</p>
