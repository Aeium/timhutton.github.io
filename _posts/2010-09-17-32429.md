<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">" So I took out my Snuff-gun and tried it on him. The snuff in it is so potent that one shot, delivered somewhere in the region of a man's moustache, is quite enough. It is now eleven o'clock at night. Prahlad is still sneezing. If my calculations are correct, he will continue to sneeze for the next thirty-three hours. "<br/>

<br/>Written by the famous film-maker <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyajit_Ray" rel="nofollow">Satyajit Ray</a>, <a href="http://www.satyajitrayworld.com/rayfiction/shonku.aspx" rel="nofollow">Professor Shonku</a> is a genius inventor who has wonderful adventures with his cat Newton and his household robot Bidhushekhar. One day he's inventing a machine to make birds intelligent, the next he's foiling a dastardly plot by a Swedish scientist to miniaturise famous people.<br/>
<br/>It's really good. It's like H. G. Wells for kids: playful, scientific and moral.<br/>
<br/>There are lots of other Professor Shonku books but they're quite hard to get hold of in the UK. PenguinIndia <a href="http://www.penguinbooksindia.com/BrowesBook.aspx?key=shonku&amp;Author=&amp;Title=&amp;ISBN13=&amp;Publisher=&amp;Category=" rel="nofollow">sell them</a> but not Penguin UK. You can find them on the used book market. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=shonku&amp;x=18&amp;y=13" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> sells the one above, and offer a few others second-hand. <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/products?q=shonku&amp;hl=en&amp;aq=f" rel="nofollow">Google shopping</a> finds a few more for sale.<br/><br/>Thanks to Susanta for introducing me!</div><p><hr></p><p>This post was <a href="http://ferkeltongs.livejournal.com/32429.html">originally on LiveJournal</a>.</p>
