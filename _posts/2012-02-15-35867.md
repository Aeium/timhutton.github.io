<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">Sometimes it's interesting to pick up on the fleeting thoughts that your brain throws out, before they get processed as nonsense. Here's one that just happened to me:<br/><br/>I went to make some coffee in the kitchen. <br/><br/>1) I noticed that a drawer had been left open. I closed it.<br/><br/>2) After making the coffee I remembered that I needed a knife for my apple, so I opened the drawer and got one out. <br/><br/>My brain now says to me: Maybe you can walk off now without closing the drawer, because you've already closed it. You could walk off without closing it and then look round and it would be closed. Maybe step (1) happened *after* step (2) and you just forgot which order they were in. <br/><br/>Thanks brain!</div><p><hr></p><p>This post was <a href="http://ferkeltongs.livejournal.com/35867.html">originally on LiveJournal</a>.</p>
