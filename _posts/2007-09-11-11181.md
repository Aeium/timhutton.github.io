title: the bus test
---

<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">After the <a href="http://ferkeltongs.livejournal.com/10467.html" rel="nofollow">sanity check</a>, another little talked about software test is the <a href="http://www.isp-planet.com/business/bus-test.html" rel="nofollow"><b>bus test</b></a>. If your code is completely incomprehensible and all developed by one person, were they to be hit by a bus then your project would be in serious trouble.<br/><br/>And this is the real reason why software development projects are so expensive - to be awarded full business practice compliance each project must at a key stage of development execute its central architect, in order to demonstrate its resilience. There's even a secret test track hidden in the New Forest where automated buses are ploughed into software engineers at high speeds. <br/><br/>And <i>this</i> is why management often call themselves 'executives', to remind the junior programmers that the threat of the New Forest hangs forever over their heads.</div><p><hr></p><p>This post was <a href="http://ferkeltongs.livejournal.com/11181.html">originally on LiveJournal</a>.</p>
