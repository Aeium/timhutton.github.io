Hello. This is me exploring Jekyll as a blog platform.

I like that everything is a text file.

I like that it picks up files in the <tt>_posts</tt> folder automatically.

I like that when hosting on Github there is nothing to run - it just all works magically.

I like that you can write posts as either <tt>.md</tt> files or <tt>.html</tt>.

I like that you can include javascript canvas elements:

<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100" style="border:1px solid #d3d3d3;">
Your browser does not support the HTML5 canvas tag.</canvas>

<script>
var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(95,50,40,0,2*Math.PI);
ctx.stroke();
</script>
  
I like that it knows about code syntax highlighting:

{% highlight c++ %}
int main()
{
    return 1;
}
{% endhighlight %}
