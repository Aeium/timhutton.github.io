<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">Recursive geometry is so much fun. You've seen those <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system" rel="nofollow">fractal plants</a> and <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&amp;q=fractal+terrain&amp;btnG=Search+Images" rel="nofollow">terrains</a>. Here's a really simple way of making pleasing <a href="http://www.starkdavingmad.com/jpg/escher1.jpg" rel="nofollow">Escher-like</a> townscapes:<br/><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tim.hutton/ComputerGraphics/photo#5075867083553516098" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/tim.hutton/RnEaOCpOKkI/AAAAAAAAAbM/g8wIwt1gEto/s144/city1.jpg"/></a><br/>(click to see larger version)<br/><br/>the same, viewed from above:<br/><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tim.hutton/ComputerGraphics/photo#5075874934753733202" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/tim.hutton/RnEhXCpOKlI/AAAAAAAAAbY/gSZiVaC78Ug/s144/city2.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Starting with one large oblong where you want the town, repeatedly apply one of these:<br/><ul><br/><li>break oblong into two smaller oblongs with a gap between them (two city blocks and a road), or</li><br/><li>break oblong into four smaller oblongs around a courtyard, or</li><br/><li>break oblong into two oblongs of different height.</li><br/></ul>After several subdivisions you get towns like those above. You can decorate it with windows and stairs and whatever you want. You need to tweak the randomness to taste.<br/><br/>Tools: C++, <a href="http://vtk.org" rel="nofollow">VTK</a>, <a href="http://blender.org" rel="nofollow">Blender</a></div>
