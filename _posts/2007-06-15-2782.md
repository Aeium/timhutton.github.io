title: beware the F12
---

<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">So recently I wasted a whole morning trying to work out why my program would throw an exception when I hit F12. Eventually I find this 'feature report' from Microsoft Visual Studio, which explains it:<br/><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q130667/" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q13<wbr></wbr>0667/</a><br/><blockquote><i>"This can be annoying..."<br/><br/>"..there is no way to disable this functionality.."</i></blockquote><br/>Arrggh, so it's a feature, not a bug. Of course it is.<br/><br/>But then I find out that Bill Gates was on the Daily Show in January, and got asked:<br/><br/><b>Jon Stewart:</b> What does the F12 button do?<br/><b>Bill Gates:</b> I'd stay away from that if I were you.<br/>(<a href="http://www.chette.com/main/content/view/97/+f12+bill+gates&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=5&amp;gl=uk" rel="nofollow">more...</a>)<br/><br/>And so now I wonder if Bill Gates had q130667 in the back of his mind when he answered that question... People need to know.<br/><br/>(The knowledgebase article says it only occurs on NT with Visual Studio 6 or earlier but it happens to me with Studio 7 on Win XP Pro SP1, so it's out of date.)</div><p><hr></p><p>This post was <a href="http://ferkeltongs.livejournal.com/2782.html">originally on LiveJournal</a>.</p>
