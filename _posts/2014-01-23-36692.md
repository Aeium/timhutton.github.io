title: Changing history in a self-consistent universe
---

<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">Some time ago, my five-year old daughter and I were playing a game, where she had drawn a 'wishing circle' that we could use to make wishes. She went first, and wished for sweets. "Ta-da!" she exclaimed, and pointed on top of the fridge where we had some. I joined in the game, saying that I wished I had a lovely sweet daughter. "Ta-da!" she cried and gave me a hug with her 'loving' face on. <br/><br/>Now, obviously this was just a silly game we were playing. She explained to Mum that it was a <i>pretend</i> wishing circle, not a real one. But later it struck me that this is exactly what having the power to change history would be like in a self-consistent universe. All of our memories would be consistent with the new history, of course, and we wouldn't <i>really</i> believe that we had the power to change history (that would be logically impossible) but still we would try and who knows, maybe we succeeded. <br/><br/>I have no idea what the universe was like before those wishes. I strongly believe that it is better now that a) I have a daughter, and b) she has sweets on top of the fridge.<br/><br/><hr/><br/>More: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle" rel="nofollow">Novikov self-consistency principle</a></div><p><hr></p><p>This post was <a href="http://ferkeltongs.livejournal.com/36692.html">originally on LiveJournal</a>.</p>
