<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">"The crowd has vanished! Er-- um... they're gone. Everyone has gone. Thousands of people have just gone. Er... um... right in front of my eyes. Um... it's impossible! Bob, can we join you, um, in the box? (silence - footage cuts to empty box) Bob? Not you too, Bob?"<br/><br/>"Over eighty-thousand spectators and thirteen thousand athletes... Er... they're gone! All of those people. Er... it's a terrible, terrible turn of events..."<br/><br/>"It's much more than a torch now, it's a beacon. It's a beacon of hope and fortitude and courage. And it's a beacon of love. "<br/><br/>"Just look at this! Utterly incredibly scenes at the Olympics stadium - eighty thousand athletes and spectators, they disappeared - they've come back! They've returned. They've reappeared. It's quite incredible. Bob, this will certainly... There's a mystery man - he's picked up the flame... we've no idea who he is... erm... he's carrying the flame, yes! He's carrying the flame and no one wants to stop him. It's more than a flame now, Bob. It's more than heat and light. It's hope. And it's courage. And it's love."<br/><br/><blockquote><a href="http://news.google.co.uk/news?hl=en&amp;q=olympic+torch+protests&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">olympic torch relay protests</a> <i>(thanks to <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/tv/2007/08/is_huw_edwards_the_modernday_g.html" rel="nofollow">feelinglistless</a>)</i></blockquote></div><p><hr></p><p>This post was <a href="http://ferkeltongs.livejournal.com/17075.html">originally on LiveJournal</a>.</p>
