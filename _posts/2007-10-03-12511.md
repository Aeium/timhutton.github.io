<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">The <a href="http://xkcd.com/324/" rel="nofollow">latest XKCD</a> made me think... <br/><br/>... you could rig up a robotic tapping machine, with prodding metallic fingers, to tap at a given object, such as a desk, or a collection of tin pans. It would first record the sound made by each one, and then work out which note each tap made, and then proceed to play a series of old-timey musical numbers to delight and amuse.</div>
