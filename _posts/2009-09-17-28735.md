title: The Milky Way

<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">When I was a kid I used to love the nights when it was clear enough to see the Milky Way as an arch across the sky, a bit like this:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.panoramio.com/photo/5177963" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/5177963.jpg"/>(source)</a><br/><br/>I remember wondering why it was lumpy and not smooth.<br/><br/>Now with recent photos I've finally realised that the blotchiness is caused by dust clouds blocking the light in patches. In a new panoramic image of the whole thing you can see it very clearly:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.eso.org/gallery/v/ESOPIA/Galaxies/phot-32a-09-fullres.tif.html" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Milkyway_pan1.jpg"/>(click for high-res)</a><br/><br/>You can see that the glowing mass of stars behind is a perfect streak of light, with patchy black clouds in front. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way" rel="nofollow">Milky Way</a> is a spiral galaxy of course but because we're in it ("far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:236084main_MilkyWay-full-annotated.jpg" rel="nofollow">western spiral arm</a>") it looks like a line, with a bulge in the middle at the centre of the galaxy.<br/><br/>You can see the clouds here too in another galaxy:<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Messier51_sRGB.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Messier51_sRGB.jpg/300px-Messier51_sRGB.jpg"/>(click for high-res)</a></div><p><hr></p><p>This post was <a href="http://ferkeltongs.livejournal.com/28735.html">originally on LiveJournal</a>.</p>
