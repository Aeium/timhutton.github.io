<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">Hey, you can see my name appear in this video!<br/><br/><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="lj_embedcontent" frameborder="0" height="225" name="embed_4339226_21" src="http://l.lj-toys.com/?auth_token=sessionless%3A1491904800%3Aembedcontent%3A4339226%2621%26%260%26vimeo%267048785%3A4c9183967aeb639266e15f7b36351785822285c3&amp;source=vimeo&amp;vid=7048785&amp;moduleid=21&amp;preview=0&amp;journalid=4339226&amp;noads=" width="400"></iframe><br/><br/>It's a visualisation of the contributions to <a href="http://www.vtk.org" rel="nofollow">VTK</a>, an open source project that I did some work on a few years ago (just a few tiny things really), and still use all the time. It's a <a href="http://vis.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ogawa/codeswarm/" rel="nofollow">code swarm</a> video, with contributions arranged by proximity to the developers who made them. The changing date is in the lower right corner.<br/><br/>Here's a similar visualisation of the Python project, showing a sudden increase in around 2000 when Python really took off.<br/><br/><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="lj_embedcontent" frameborder="0" height="302" name="embed_4339226_22" src="http://l.lj-toys.com/?auth_token=sessionless%3A1491904800%3Aembedcontent%3A4339226%2622%26%260%26vimeo%261093745%3A091dd8a14b9bb702fa1eccc8572698e5413d2278&amp;source=vimeo&amp;vid=1093745&amp;moduleid=22&amp;preview=0&amp;journalid=4339226&amp;noads=" width="400"></iframe><br/><br/>This form of dynamic graphing is a bit like that amazing TED talk from last year, showing bubble graphs of the economic and social performance of different countries over time: <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_at_state.html" rel="nofollow">Hans Rosling: Let my dataset change your mindset</a>.<br/><br/>But the difference here is that in the TED talk he's using numerical figures. With the source code changes it's just a set of text files being edited by different people. The spatial layout is computed (presumably) by <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=graph%20visualization" rel="nofollow">graph visualisation algorithms</a> simply from the associations between which developers worked on which files at what dates. And while there are many ways of doing that, finding a way that actually makes visual sense is impressive. And with the music on the Python one it's rather beautiful.</div>
