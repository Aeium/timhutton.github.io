title: only disconnect

<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">I just had the strangest moment.<br/><br/>Working with some wireframe meshes on computer, deleting some faces...<br/><br/>Went to drink from my coffee mug... There reflected in the surface was a wireframe world, all solid structures rendered see-through and outlined. I recoiled in horror, the terror mounting as my brain backpedalled frantically through all its assumptions about how the world works, desperately trying to explain what it was seeing.<br/><br/>And then realised it was just the wire mesh around my desk fan, being reflected.<br/><br/><img src="http://www.livingincomfort.com/images/medium/ec3speedosde_pic.jpg"/><br/><br/>And now I'm reminded of this sculpture by Ben Radcliffe which I guess exploits the same disconnect:<br/><br/><img src="http://news.windingroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/wireframe-subaru.jpg"/><blockquote>(<a href="http://news.windingroad.com/etc/wonder-woman-your-car-is-ready%E2%80%A6/" rel="nofollow">more</a>...)</blockquote></div>
