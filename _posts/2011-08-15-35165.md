This face looks great but didn't work.<br/><br/><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/9T34rO9YewIKKH12TMQ3qw?feat=embedwebsite" rel="nofollow"><img height="300" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Pj6QCKcqmJs/TkmSMLZ9ZrI/AAAAAAAAExI/QPRO5ERht10/s400/IMG_2192.JPG" width="400"/></a><br/>Adding a mass of hair around this face made it work - the camera identified it as a face. But it hasn't worked in Picasa, they must have different parameters for their face detection.<br/><br/>I was at CVPR in 2001 and will never forget the moment when the speakers turned the video camera on the audience and we saw real-time face recognition for the first time, with a cloud of boxes appearing over our faces. The reaction of the audience (serious academics) was amazing, like a bunch of delighted children, all standing up and waving.</div>
