"Piku-Piku" is a smooth version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy#Wiggle_stereoscopy" rel="nofollow">wiggle stereoscopy</a>. There's a website: <a href="http://www.start3d.com" rel="nofollow">Start3D.com</a> that takes your left and right images (just move the camera a few centimeters in between each shot) and makes a smooth blend between them.
