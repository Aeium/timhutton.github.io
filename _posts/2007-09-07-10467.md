title: sanity check

<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanity_test" rel="nofollow">Sanity checks</a> in software development are quite common. When you've got a bug in your code and it doesn't make any sense, and you've looked at all the possible causes, then it is time for a sanity test. <br/><br/>It's when you find yourself staring at code that cannot possibly fail, such as:<br/><br/><blockquote>n = sqrt(fabs(gamma));</blockquote><br/><br/>and you insert this:<br/><br/><blockquote>test = fabs(gamma);<br/><br/>if(test&lt;0.0)<br/><blockquote>throw(runtime_error);</blockquote><br/>n = sqrt(test);</blockquote><br/><br/>because maybe, just maybe, you've gone completely mad and sqrt is still being passed a negative number, even though fabs shouldn't allow that.<br/><br/>And of course the purpose of a sanity check is that it <i>doesn't</i> fail, giving you the reassurance to keep looking somewhere else for the bug.<br/><br/>And so, when a sanity test <i>did</i> fail today, I was left blank faced and slack jawed. Logically, under the terms of the test, it means that I have indeed gone mad. I thereby devote myself for the rest of the day to the worship of the Friday Dragon. A fearsome beast that creeps into the brain of innocent programmers on Friday afternoons and eats all their processing cycles.</div><p><hr></p><p>This post was <a href="http://ferkeltongs.livejournal.com/10467.html">originally on LiveJournal</a>.</p>
