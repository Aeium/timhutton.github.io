<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">(My <a href="http://ferkeltongs.livejournal.com/29209.html" rel="nofollow">obsession</a> with Ludovico Einaudi continues...)<br/><br/>The first track on his album Divenire is called <b>Uno</b>. It's just piano and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_who#Music" rel="nofollow">loops</a>, pretty minimalist (as he has been described but doesn't describe himself). Especially in the middle it sounds like nothing so much as Radiohead's <b>Pyramid Song</b>. <br/><br/>Compare:<ul><li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Xccx1HKQI" rel="nofollow">Uno</a> (ignore the ridiculous Lego video!)</li><li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy6JltOxLfo" rel="nofollow">Pyramid Song</a><br/></li></ul><br/><a href="http://ticklebooth.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/pyramid-song.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://ticklebooth.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/pyramid-song.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>It's nice to get confused about genres.<br/><br/>(I've just booked tickets to go and see Einaudi perform <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/ludovico-einaudi" rel="nofollow">in Birmingham</a>!)</div>
