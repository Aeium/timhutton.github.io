title: Face Asymmetry in Autism
---

<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">We made the cover of (Nature) Molecular Psychiatry:<br/><br/><img src="http://www.nature.com/cimages/mp_cimage.jpg"/><br/><a href="http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v13/n6/covers/index.html" rel="nofollow">[about the cover image]</a><br/><a href="http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/mp.2008.18" rel="nofollow">[article]</a><br/><br/>To summarise the summary:<br/><br/>We found that autistic boys* have a significant facial asymmetry, which wasn't realised before. We did this by taking 3D scans of 72 autistic boys and comparing them to 254 unaffected controls. The 3D face scans were aligned using dense surface modelling, my PhD work.<br/><br/>Why is the face asymmetric? We know that the brain develops asymmetrically in children with autism, so it is not unexpected that the face would show the same effect, it just hadn't been shown before.<br/><br/><font size="-2"><br/>* Most autistic children <i>are</i> boys, by a ratio of 4:1. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#Epidemiology" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><br/></font></div>
