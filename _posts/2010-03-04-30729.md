<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">I'm on a bit of a Kurt Vonnegut mission at the moment, having read two of his books for the first time: Cat's Cradle and Sirens of Titan, both excellent and irreverent sci-fi.<br/><br/>Here's a snippet from a brilliant <a href="http://theparisreview.org/viewinterview.php/prmMID/3605" rel="nofollow">interview</a> with him from the 1970's: <blockquote><br/>VONNEGUT<br/>... Technically, I wasn't really a snarf. A snarf was a person who went around sniffing girlsâ€™ bicycle saddles. I didn't do that. Twerp also had a very specific meaning, which few people know now. Through careless usage, twerp is a pretty formless insult now.<br/><br/>INTERVIEWER<br/>What is a twerp in the strictest sense, in the original sense?<br/><br/>VONNEGUT<br/>It's a person who inserts a set of false teeth between the cheeks of his ass.<br/><br/>INTERVIEWER<br/>I see.<br/><br/>VONNEGUT<br/>I beg your pardon; between the cheeks of his or her ass. I'm always offending feminists that way.<br/><br/>INTERVIEWER<br/>I don't quite understand why someone would do that with false teeth.<br/><br/>VONNEGUT<br/>In order to bite the buttons off the backseats of taxicabs. That's the only reason twerps do it. It's all that turns them on.<br/></blockquote><br/>(<a href="http://www.cynical-c.com/?p=16525" rel="nofollow">via</a>)<br/><br/><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/File:Kurt_Vonnegut_at_CWRU.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c8/Kurt_Vonnegut_at_CWRU.jpg"/> (source)</a></div><p><hr></p><p>This post was <a href="http://ferkeltongs.livejournal.com/30729.html">originally on LiveJournal</a>.</p>
