<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">rice pudding is back on now, we bought another packet.<br/><br/>in other rice pudding news, i discovered that the best way to make rice pudding is to follow the recipe on the back of the packet exactly, measuring everything very carefully, except putting twice as much milk in as they suggest, cooking it for longer than they suggest, and at a lower temperature.<br/><br/>that is all the rice pudding news I have for you today.</div><p><hr></p><p>This post was <a href="http://ferkeltongs.livejournal.com/2233.html">originally on LiveJournal</a>.</p>
