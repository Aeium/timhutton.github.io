<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">In tribute to J. G. Ballard I'd like to share this story of his.<br/><br/>It's called 'The Index', and you can read it online: <br/><br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/reader/0374525765?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ref_=sib_dp_pt#reader" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L3XQL9bgmnM/Sew2pd8vs0I/AAAAAAAACXM/sER4uIem_n8/s800/the_index.png"/></a><br/><br/>(This loads Amazon's `look inside' feature (needs javascript). Click on the link on the left: 'Index'.)<br/><br/>The story takes the form of an index of a (non-existent) book. You can work out what happens to the main character (HRH) through the references listed. Fortunately he lives his life in a remarkably alphabetical order.<br/><br/>There's a review and explanation of the story here:<br/><a href="http://www.ballardian.com/indexed-out-of-existence" rel="nofollow">http://www.ballardian.com/indexed-out-o<wbr></wbr>f-existence</a><br/><br/>The amusing thing is that Amazon don't seem to have realised that they've actually made one of his stories available - they think they've uploaded the actual index of 'War Fever', the volume in which the story appears. This mistake is itself a tribute to Ballard, in a way.</div><p><hr></p><p>This post was <a href="http://ferkeltongs.livejournal.com/25606.html">originally on LiveJournal</a>.</p>
