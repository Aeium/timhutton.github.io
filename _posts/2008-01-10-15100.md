<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">Everyone's favourite Indian granny, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0782247/" rel="nofollow">Zohra Sehgal</a>:<br/><br/><img src="http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2004/09/15/images/2004091500600201.jpg"/><br/><i>(here advertising hearing aids, as <a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2004/09/15/stories/2004091500600200.htm" rel="nofollow">reported in The Hindu</a>)</i><br/><br/>A sprightly 95 years old, Zohra is still working hard, having appeared in such great films as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286499/" rel="nofollow">Bend it like Beckham</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0347304/" rel="nofollow">Kal Ho Naa Ho</a>.<br/><br/>And delightfully, I now discover that she even appeared in some episodes of Dr Who, in the William Hartnell years. The BBC (despite having lost this episode) have photos of her <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/photonovels/crusade/two/20.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a>:<br/><br/><img src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/photonovels/crusade/two/340/20.jpg"/><br/><i>(a frame from "The Knight of Jaffa", an episode of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crusade_%28Doctor_Who%29" rel="nofollow">The Crusade</a>", 1965)</i><br/><br/>(IMDB says she also appeared in three Dr Who episodes from "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo_%28Doctor_Who%29" rel="nofollow">Marco Polo</a>" (1964) but all of those are missing too.)<br/><br/>I love these connections. Did you know that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/goodlife/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">Felicity Kendal</a>'s <a href="http://www.tongs.org.uk/wiki.pl?JenniferKendal" rel="nofollow">sister</a> married <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raj_Kapoor" rel="nofollow">Raj Kapoor</a>'s brother? And of course when you look, Zohra Sehgal turns out to be a <a href="http://movies.indiatimes.com/articleshow/487456.cms" rel="nofollow">friend of the family</a>...</div>
