<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">You know when you're on holiday, and you're in a shop looking for snack food and there's nothing you recognise? You're staring at <a href="http://homemades.blogspot.com/2008/01/not-so-ordinary-tongues.html" rel="nofollow">langues de chat</a>, or <a href="http://ronnysandra.multiply.com/recipes/item/8" rel="nofollow">germknoedel</a>, or <a href="http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com/biscuits/previous.php3?item=110" rel="nofollow">galettes bretonnes</a> and wondering if they're sweet or savoury. And you buy them and they're always a surprise and slightly strange. And sometimes a bit horrid. Well it's just happened to me here, by proxy. F-, a wonderful chap from Ecuador who is always adventurous and generous, just brought in a packet of scones. And being unfamiliar with them, he offered them like small cakes from the packet. And we ate them, and agreed that they were a bit odd.</div>
